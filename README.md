Password Complexity Checker

Description:
The Password Complexity Checker is a Python-based tool designed to evaluate the strength of a user's password based on several criteria. This tool helps users create stronger passwords by providing immediate feedback on their password's strength and highlighting areas for improvement.

Features:

Length Check: Ensures the password is at least 8 characters long.
Uppercase Letter Check: Verifies the presence of at least one uppercase letter.

Functionality:

Input: The user is prompted to enter a password.
Processing: The password is evaluated against the defined criteria.
Output: The tool provides feedback on the password's strength, which can be one of the following:
Very Weak: Meets 0-1 criteria.
Weak: Meets 2 criteria.
Moderate: Meets 3 criteria.
Strong: Meets 4 criteria.
Very Strong: Meets all 5 criteria.
Additionally, it details which specific criteria are met or not met, offering clear guidance on how to improve the password's strength.

Usage:
This tool is ideal for users who want to enhance their online security by creating robust passwords. It can be used as a standalone application or integrated into larger systems where password strength validation is required.
